Products like Gloves, Shoes and Socks are sold out in the South region; Hat, Shirt and Jacket are sold out in the East; Hat,Gloves,Shoe and Socks are sold out in the West; Hat,Shirt and Jacket are sold out in the North region. This means that most of the product has no sales in some regions.

I recommend that, strategic marketing and Advertisment should be adopted to introduced some of these products to the regions where they are barely used.This will help to increase the overall sales.
